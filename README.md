# Project Name: Capstone
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree - Dog Breed Identification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Data source
Provided within the project by Udacity 

## Python libraries used:
   See requirements.txt    

## Purpose:
Create a CNN to classify dog breed based the given image. 
Use Tensorflow backend.

## Process:
  Step 0: Import Datasets
  Step 1: Detect Humans
  Step 2: Detect Dogs
  Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
  Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
  Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
  Step 6: Write my own Algorithm
  Step 7: Test my own Algorithm
