# Project Name: Capstone
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree - Dog Breed Identification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Data source
Provided within the project by Udacity 

## Python libraries used:
   See requirements.txt    

## Purpose:
Create a CNN to classify dog breed based the given image. 
Use Tensorflow backend.

## Process:
